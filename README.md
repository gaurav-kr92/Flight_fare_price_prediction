# Flight_fare_price_prediction

. Developed & implemented a flight fare prediction model using supervised machine learning algorithms to optimize pricing for airline travel
• Handled Categorical Data with OneHot Encoding, applied EDA, used HeatMap and ExtraTreesRegressor for feature Selection
• Evaluated the model using RandomForest to train the datasets and achieved R2 score of 0.80 using Confusion Matrix on test datasets.
